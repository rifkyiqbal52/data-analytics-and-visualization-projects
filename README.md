# Used Vehicle Entry Within The United States on Craigslist Data Analysis
I am currently training to become a Data Analyst by working on a major project to solve a client's problem.

In this project, I will conduct data analysis using statistics and visualization dashboards to help address the existing problem statement.

## Background:

The used car market remains a popular trading sector to this day, especially in countries with high mobility and a strong interest in car modification. The high demand and supply in this market are influenced by various factors such as price, vehicle condition, mileage, brand, year of manufacture, and more.

However, despite the strong interest in used car sales, both sellers and buyers still face difficulties in determining fair and competitive prices. Therefore, I conducted a data analysis using a dataset obtained from the Kaggle website. The data was collected and analyzed with the aim of helping to address this issue.

This analysis also opens opportunities to build a predictive pricing model, which can be highly valuable for consumers, sellers, and vehicle trading platforms to enhance market efficiency and transparency.
